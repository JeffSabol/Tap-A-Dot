# Tap-A-Dot
Tap-A-Dot is a simple game built with Phaser and http-server that challenges you to tap as many dots as you can in a limited amount of time. This game was my first attempt at developing a game using Phaser, and it was a fun and educational experience.

## How to run 
First install http-server via npm by running:
`npm install --global http-server`
In a web browser by navigating to http://localhost:8080/
Click the "Play Now" button to start the game.
Tap the dots as quickly as possible to score points while avoiding bad dots (skull and bombs).
The game ends after the time runs out, and your final score will be displayed.

## Technologies Used
* Phaser: A popular open-source game development framework for creating HTML5 games.
* http-server: A simple command-line tool that allows you to easily launch a local web server for testing and development.

## What I Learned
Game design: I learned the basics of designing a simple game that is fun and challenging.
Game mechanics: I learned how to create a scoring system, a timer, and a way to track user input.
JavaScript programming: I improved my JavaScript skills by working with Phaser and creating interactive elements.
